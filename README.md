# WIP patches for Tridactyl and Firefox

I hope that one day these will allow Tridactyl (and other extensions if they try hard enough) to run on more pages.

At the moment they don't.

Mozilla thinks patches like these are an extreme security risk. I do not. You would be unwise to listen to me rather than Mozilla.
